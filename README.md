# hello, well-logging Induction-log-Resistivity-inversion 
This content is well-logging Induction-log-Resistivity-inversion codes With introduced with a five-parameter formation resistivity model To obtain the resistivity of uninvaded and invaded zones. Written in 100% Matlab. Two codes are uploaded,  using the Levenberg Marquardt and Bayesian optimization techniques.  
The code was developed for hybrid inversion to integrate the above-introduced two optimization techniques. Matlab 2021 or above can be used to run the code.
The two codes are uploaded in format text “txt” and “m” Matlab format files,  namely 
code1 is for the Bayesian technique 
code 2 is for developed Levenberg Marquardt.
