 This content is well-logging Induction-log-Resistivity-inversion codes With the introduced resistivity formation model. Written in 100% Matlab. Two codes are uploaded,  using the Levenberg Marquardt and Bayesian optimization techniques. To obtain the resistivity of uninvaded and invaded zones. 
The code was developed for hybrid inversion to integrate the above-introduced two optimization techniques. Matlab 2021 or above can be used to run the code.
The two codes are uploaded in format text “txt” and “m” Matlab format files,  namely 
code1 is for the Bayesian technique 
code 2 is for developed Levenberg Marquardt.
