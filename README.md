# Hello, this is Mohammed Ishag, PhD geosciences, China University of Petroleum (East China).
This content is Well-log. Induction-log-Resistivity-inversion codes. Recently, we incorporated the resistivity formation model.
We designed the code to simulate and invert the measured well log resistivity data, examining the impact of mud invasion and determining the true formation resistivity using a combination of Bayesian Levenberg-Marquardt optimization techniques. Written in 100% Matlab.

How to use the code:

For convenience, we upload the two codes, code 1 and code 2, as "txt" and "m" Matlab format files. You can run the code on Matlab 2021 or higher.

We upload the two codes separately to facilitate simple analysis.

Code 1 refers to the Bayesian method that is used to obtain the posterior model parameters.

Code 2 solves the non-linear least squares problem for model parameters using the Levenberg-Marquardt method.

The codes specify the model's definitions.
